Calling Card

Its about time we put some of this new knowledge to use. We have learned about creating a ASP.NET Core app, using MVC, and simple aspects of returning JSON. Before we move into views we will practice routing, route parameters and JSON responses with a quick assignment.

Create a simple app that reads in parameters from a single GET route and renders the values with a JSON response. Your route should accept four parameters:

First Name
Last Name
Age
Favorite Color
A user using your app would expect to enter a route such as http://localhost/Tim/Toolmam/42/Brown to which you should display the appropriate information as a JSON response.
